# Drink Water-Notifier
Nowadays, we're so busy with our work that we often forget to fulfil our body water requirement goal. But one place that we're completely indulged with is our Laptop/Desktop. 
This bot helps you achieve your goal by appearing on top of your all running apps by asking you to Drink water first & then continuing with what you were doing. 

Now, since the link was already broken with what you were doing already, GO DRINK WATER NOW !
